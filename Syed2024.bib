@article{Li:2015aa,
	abstract = {Accurate quantitative measurement of structural dispersion in proteins remains a prime challenge to both X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Here we use a model-free approach based on measurement of many residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) in differentially orienting aqueous liquid crystalline solutions to obtain the side chain {$\gamma$}1 distribution sampled by each residue in solution. Applied to the small well-ordered model protein GB3, our approach reveals that the RDC data are compatible with a single narrow distribution of side chain {$\gamma$}1 angles for only about 40{\%} of the residues. For more than half of the residues, populations greater than 10{\%} for a second rotamer are observed, and four residues require sampling of three rotameric states to fit the RDC data. In virtually all cases, sampled {$\gamma$}1 values are found to center closely around ideal g--, g+ and t rotameric angles, even though no rotamer restraint is used when deriving the sampled angles. The root-mean-square difference between experimental 3JH{$\alpha$}H{$\beta$}couplings and those predicted by the Haasnoot-parametrized, motion-adjusted Karplus equation reduces from 2.05 to 0.75 Hz when using the new rotamer analysis instead of the 1.1-{\AA}X-ray structure as input for the dihedral angles. A comparison between observed and predicted 3JH{$\alpha$}H{$\beta$}values suggests that the root-mean-square amplitude of {$\gamma$}1 angle fluctuations within a given rotamer well is ca. 20$\,^{\circ}$. The quantitatively defined side chain rotamer equilibria obtained from our study set new benchmarks for evaluating improved molecular dynamics force fields, and also will enable further development of quantitative relations between side chain chemical shift and structure.},

	abstract = {Experiments are presented for the measurement of one-bond carbon−proton dipolar coupling values at CH and CH2 positions in 13C-labeled, ∼50{\%} fractionally deuterated proteins. 13C{$\beta$}−1H{$\beta$}dipolar couplings have been measured for 38 of 49 possible residues in the 63-amino-acid B1 domain of peptostreptococcal protein L in two aligning media and interpreted in the context of side-chain {$\gamma$}1 torsion angle dynamics. The {$\beta$}protons for 18 of the 25 {$\beta$}-methylene-containing amino acids for which dipolar data are available can be unambiguously stereoassigned, and for those residues which are best fit to a single rotamer model the {$\gamma$}1 angles obtained deviate from crystal structure values by only 5.2$\,^{\circ}$(rmsd). The results for 11 other residues are significantly better fit by a model that assumes jumps between the three canonical ({$\gamma$}1 ≈−60$\,^{\circ}$, 60$\,^{\circ}$, 180$\,^{\circ}$) rotamers. Relative populations of the rotamers are determined to within $\pm$6{\%} uncertainty on average and correlate with dihedral angles observed for the three molecules in the crystal asymmetric unit.

@article{Smith:2021aa,
	abstract = {Values of 3J-couplings as obtained from NMR experiments on proteins cannot easily be used to determine protein structure due to the difficulty of accounting for the high sensitivity of intermediate 3J-coupling values (4--8 Hz) to the averaging period that must cover the conformational variability of the torsional angle related to the 3J-coupling, and due to the difficulty of handling the multiple-valued character of the inverse Karplus relation between torsional angle and 3J-coupling. Both problems can be solved by using 3J-coupling time-averaging local-elevation restraining MD simulation. Application to the protein hen egg white lysozyme using 213 backbone and side-chain 3J-coupling restraints shows that a conformational ensemble compatible with the experimental data can be obtained using this technique, and that accounting for averaging and the ability of the algorithm to escape from local minima for the torsional angle induced by the Karplus relation, are essential for a comprehensive use of 3J-coupling data in protein structure determination.},

@article{Steiner:2012aa,
	abstract = {Structural knowledge about proteins is mainly derived from values of observables, measurable in NMR spectroscopic or X-ray diffraction experiments, i.e. absorbed or scattered intensities, through theoretically derived relationships between structural quantities such as atom positions or torsional angles on the one hand and observable quantities such as squared structure factor amplitudes, NOE intensities or 3J-coupling constants on the other. The standardly used relation connecting 3J-couplings to torsional angles is the Karplus relation, which is used in protein structure refinement as well as in the evaluation of simulated properties of proteins. The accuracy of the simple and generalised Karplus relations is investigated using side-chain structural and 3J{$\alpha$}{$\beta$}-coupling data for three different proteins, Plastocyanin, Lysozyme, and FKBP, for which such data are available. The results show that the widely used Karplus relations are only a rough estimate for the relation between 3J{$\alpha$}{$\beta$}-couplings and the corresponding {$\gamma$}1-angle in proteins.},

Two pseudorotation ranges were considered, classified as type N (?2 positive sign) and type S (?2 negative sign). The conformational equilibrium is fully described in terms of four geometrical parameters (PN, τN, PS, τS) and the equilibrium constant K. The present results indicate that, in general, the geometrical properties found in x-ray studies of proline and hydroxyproline residues are well preserved in solution. Several novel features are encountered, however. It is demonstrated that the proline ring occurs in a practically 1:1 conformational equilibrium between well-defined N- and S-type forms. Introduction of an amide group at the C-terminal end has no observable effect on this equilibrium, but the formation of a peptide bond at the imino nitrogen site results in a pronounced, but not exclusive, preference for an S-type form which is roughly 1.1 kcal/mol more stable than its N-type counterpart. The hydroxyproline ring system in neutral or acidic medium displays a pure N-type state, but N-acetylation results in the appearance of a minor (S-type) conformation. Cyclic proline dipeptides similarly exist in a biased conformational equilibrium. The major form (77?88{\%}) corresponds to the N-type conformer observed in the solid state; the minor S-form has not been observed before. In contrast, cyclic hydroxyproline dipeptides display complete conformational purity. Ranges of endocyclic torsion angles deduced for the various classes of pyrrolidine derivatives in solution are presented. Each torsion appears confined to a surprisingly narrow range, comprising about 4$\,^{\circ}$?8$\,^{\circ}$in most cases. In all, the proline ring is far less ?floppy? than hitherto assumed.},

Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder--target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein--protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both. Our approach enables the targeted design of binders to sites of interest on a wide variety of proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.},

	abstract = {The computational cost for the simulation of NMR spectra grows exponentially with the number of nuclei. Today, the memory available to store the Hamiltonian limits the size of the system that can be studied. Modern computers enable to tackle systems containing up to 13 spins {$[$}1{$]$}, which obviously does not allow to study most molecules of interest in research. This issue can be addressed by identifying groups of spins or fragments that are not or only weakly interacting together, i.e., that only share weakly coupled spin pairs. Such a fragmentation is only permitted in the weak coupling regime, i.e., when the coupling interaction is weak compared to the difference in chemical shift of the coupled spins. Here, we propose a procedure that removes weak coupling interactions in order to split the spin system efficiently and to correct a posteriori for the effect of the neglected couplings. This approach yields accurate spectra when the adequate interactions are removed, i.e., between spins only involved in weak coupling interactions, but fails otherwise. As a result, the computational time for the simulation of 1D spectra grows linearly with the size of the spin system.},

	abstract = {The quantitative interpretation of 1H NMR spectra of mixtures like the biofluids is a demanding task due to spectral complexity and overlap. Complications may arise also from water suppression, T2-editing, protein interactions, relaxation differences of the species, experimental artifacts and, furthermore, the spectra may contain unknown components and macromolecular background which cannot be easily separated from baseline. In this work, tools and strategies for quantitative Quantum Mechanical Spectral Analysis (qQMSA) of 1H NMR spectra from complex mixtures were developed and systematically assessed. In the present approach, the signals of well-defined, stoichiometric components are described by a QM model, while the background is described by a multiterm baseline function and the unknown signals using optimizable and adjustable lines, regular multiplets or any spectral structures which can be composed from spectral lines. Any prior knowledge available from the spectrum can also be added to the model. Fitting strategies for weak and strongly overlapping spectral systems were developed and assessed using two basic model systems, the metabolite mixtures without and with macromolecular (serum) background. The analyses show that if the spectra are measured in high-throughput manner, the consistent absolute quantification demands some calibration to compensate the different response factors of the protons and compounds. On the other hand, the results show that also the T2-edited spectra can be measured so that they obey well the QM rules. In general, qQMSA exploits and interprets the spectral information in maximal way taking full advantage from the QM properties of the spectra and, at the same time, offers chemical confidence which means that individual components can be identified with high confidence on the basis of their accurate spectral parameters.},

	abstract = {Issues related to pharmaceutical quality are arising at an alarming rate. Pharmaceutical quality concerns both the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and the Finished Drug Product/ Formulation. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the number of reports of harmful impurities in marketed drug formulations. Impurities range from solvents, reactants, adulterants, and catalysts to synthetic byproducts. Quality concerns in commercial preparations may also arise due to shelf life stability. Furthermore, a number of falsified and substandard drug cases have been reported. Most of the techniques which are currently in place can, at best, detect the impurities, but cannot identify them unless they are already known and can be compared to a standard. On the other hand, 1H NMR spectroscopy detects all the hydrogen containing species, typically provides information to elucidate structures partially or even completely, and through its absolute quantitative capabilities even can detect the presence hydrogen-free species indirectly. The structural properties that produce 1H NMR signals as characteristic representations of a given molecule are the chemical shifts (δin ppm) and coupling constants (J in Hz). Along with the line widths (ω1/2 in Hz), these parameters are bound to both the molecule and the NMR experimental conditions by quantum mechanical (QM) principles. This means that the 1H NMR spectra of APIs can be precisely calculated and compared to the experimental data. This review explains how 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled with Full Spin Analysis can contribute towards the quality control of pharmaceuticals by improving structural dereplication and achieving simultaneous quantification of both APIs and their contaminants.},

The software also performs initial peak picking, followed by subsequent fitting and refinement of the peak list, by iteratively adding and removing peaks to improve the overall fit.

	abstract = {NMR spectroscopy is uniquely suited for atomic resolution studies of biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids and metabolites, since detailed information on structure and dynamics are encoded in positions and line shapes of peaks in NMR spectra. Unfortunately, accurate determination of these parameters is often complicated and time consuming, in part due to the need for different software at the various analysis steps and for validating the results. Here, we present an integrated, cross-platform and open-source software that is significantly more versatile than the typical line shape fitting application. The software is a completely redesigned version of PINT (https://pint-nmr.github.io/PINT/). It features a graphical user interface and includes functionality for peak picking, editing of peak lists and line shape fitting. In addition, the obtained peak intensities can be used directly to extract, for instance, relaxation rates, heteronuclear NOE values and exchange parameters. In contrast to most available software the entire process from spectral visualization to preparation of publication-ready figures is done solely using PINT and often within minutes, thereby, increasing productivity for users of all experience levels. Unique to the software are also the outstanding tools for evaluating the quality of the fitting results and extensive, but easy-to-use, customization of the fitting protocol and graphical output. In this communication, we describe the features of the new version of PINT and benchmark its performance.},

The results can be inspected visually, which facilitates systematic optimization of the line shape fitting. Finally, integrated peak volumes can be used to extract parameters such as relaxation rates and information about low populated states. The utility of PINT is demonstrated by applications to the 59 residue SH3 domain of the yeast protein Abp1p and the 289 residue kinase domain of murine EphB2.},

	abstract = {Exact numerical simulations of NMR experiments are often required for the development of new techniques and for the extraction of structural and dynamic information from the spectra. Simulations of solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) experiments can be particularly demanding both computationally and in terms of the programming required to carry them out, even if special simulation software is used. We recently developed a number of approaches that dramatically improve the efficiency and allow a high degree of automation of these computations. In the present paper, we describe SPINEVOLUTION, a highly optimized computer program that implements the new methodology. The algorithms used in the program will be described separately. Although particularly efficient for the simulation of experiments with complex pulse sequences and multi-spin systems in solids, SPINEVOLUTION is a versatile and easy to use tool for the simulation and optimization of virtually any NMR experiment. The performance of SPINEVOLUTION was compared with that of another recently developed NMR simulation package, SIMPSON. Benchmarked on a series of examples, SPINEVOLUTION was consistently found to be orders of magnitude faster. At the time of publication, the program is available gratis for non-commercial use.},

For this purpose, firstly pseudo-one-dimensional spectra are created by co-addition of individual traces of cross-peaks, and by a similar addition of diagonal peaks in a spectrum which is phase corrected to pure-absorption line shapes. The sum and difference of the pseudo-one-dimensional spectra of a cross-peak and its diagonal peak give two spectra, with a pattern in which the active coupling ceases to exist (?spin decoupling?) but is shifted by half the value of the same. If diagonal peaks are not available owing to overlapping signals, sums and differences of the pseudo-one-dimensional spectra of two cross-peaks can be applied to simplify spectral patterns for the evaluation of J values. The procedure is demonstrated with the example of the AMXY spin system of a tyrosine, and the complex pattern of the Pro8 spin system of the cyclic decapeptide antamanide. The conformation of the Pro8 ring, derived from the coupling constants thus obtained, is of the ?E type.},

The system is based on UNIX pipes, which allow programs running simultaneously to exchange streams of data under user control. In an NMRPipe processing scheme, a stream of spectral data flows through a pipeline of processing programs, each of which performs one component of the overall scheme, such as Fourier transformation or linear prediction. Complete multidimensional processing schemes are constructed as simple UNIX shell scripts. The processing modules themselves maintain and exploit accurate records of data sizes, detection modes, and calibration information in all dimensions, so that schemes can be constructed without the need to explicitly define or anticipate data sizes or storage details of real and imaginary channels during processing. The asynchronous pipeline scheme provides other substantial advantages, including high flexibility, favorable processing speeds, choice of both all-in-memory and disk-bound processing, easy adaptation to different data formats, simpler software development and maintenance, and the ability to distribute processing tasks on multi-CPU computers and computer networks.},

The backbone-dependent rotamer library consists of rotamer frequencies, mean dihedral angles, and variances as a function of the backbone dihedral angles. Structure prediction and design methods that employ backbone flexibility would strongly benefit from smoothly varying probabilities and angles. A new version of the backbone-dependent rotamer library has been developed using adaptive kernel density estimates for the rotamer frequencies and adaptive kernel regression for the mean dihedral angles and variances. This formulation allows for evaluation of the rotamer probabilities, mean angles, and variances as a smooth and continuous function of phi and psi. Continuous probability density estimates for the nonrotameric degrees of freedom of amides, carboxylates, and aromatic side chains have been modeled as a function of the backbone dihedrals and rotamers of the remaining degrees of freedom. New backbone-dependent rotamer libraries at varying levels of smoothing are available from http://dunbrack.fccc.edu.},

Application to the protein Desulfovibrio vulgaris flavodoxin demonstrates the simultaneous refinement of torsion-angle values and related Karplus coefficients.

	abstract = {Recently proposed self-consistent 3J coupling analysis (Schmidt, J. M.; Bl{\"u}mel, M.; L{\"o}hr, F.; R{\"u}terjans, H. J. Biomol. NMR 1999, 14, 1-12) has been carried out to calibrate Karplus parameters constituting the empirical dependence of 3J coupling constants on the chi1 dihedral angle in amino acid side chains. The procedure involves simultaneous least-squares optimization of six sets of three Karplus coefficients related to all six 3J coupling types accessible in 15N,13C-labeled proteins. A simple concept of fundamental and incremental component couplings is proposed to account for substituent effects, eventually yielding amino acid topology-specific Karplus parameters. The method is exemplified with recombinant Desulfovibrio vulgaris flavodoxin (147 amino acids, 16 kDa) with reference to a total of 749 experimental 3JHalpha,Hbeta, 3JN',Hbeta, 3JC',Hbeta, 3JHalpha,Cgamma, 3JN',Cgamma, and 3JC',Cgamma coupling constants. Unlike other parametrizations, the present method does not make reference to X-ray coordinates, so that the Karplus coefficients obtained are not influenced by differences between solution and crystal states. Cross validation using X-ray torsion angles demonstrates the improvement relative to previous parametrizations. The Karplus coefficients derived are applicable to other proteins, too. Parameter refinement also yields a series of chi1 torsion angles, providing valuable constraints for protein structure determination, as well as optional parameters of local angular mobility in the contexts of Gaussian random fluctuation or a three-site jump model. The procedure permits automatic stereospecific assignments of Hbeta and Cgamma chemical shifts. The majority of the flavodoxin side-chain conformations agrees with high-resolution X-ray structures of the protein. Marked deviations between NMR and X-ray datasets are attributed to different rotameric states due to crystal-packing effects and to conformational equilibria between multiple chi1 rotamers.},

	abstract = {The exceptionally rich information content of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra is routinely used to identify and characterize molecules and molecular interactions in a wide range of applications, including clinical biomarker discovery, drug discovery, environmental chemistry, and metabolomics. The set of peak positions and intensities from a reference NMR spectrum generally serves as the identifying signature for a compound. Reference spectra normally are collected under specific conditions of pH, temperature, and magnetic field strength, because changes in conditions can distort the identifying signatures of compounds. A spin system matrix that parametrizes chemical shifts and coupling constants among spins provides a much richer feature set for a compound than a spectral signature based on peak positions and intensities. Spin system matrices expand the applicability of NMR spectral libraries beyond the specific conditions under which data were collected. In addition to being able to simulate spectra at any field strength, spin parameters can be adjusted to systematically explore alterations in chemical shift patterns due to variations in other experimental conditions, such as compound concentration, pH, or temperature. We present methodology and software for efficient interactive optimization of spin parameters against experimental 1D-(1)H NMR spectra of small molecules. We have used the software to generate spin system matrices for a set of key mammalian metabolites and are also using the software to parametrize spectra of small molecules used in NMR-based ligand screening. The software, along with optimized spin system matrix data for a growing number of compounds, is available from http://gissmo.nmrfam.wisc.edu/ .},

@article{Dudley:2020,
	abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a valuable tool for determining the structures of molecules and probing their dynamics. A longstanding problem facing both small-molecule and macromolecular NMR is overlapped signals in crowded spectra. To address this, we have developed a method that extracts peak features by fitting analytically derived models of NMR lineshapes. The approach takes into account the effects of truncation, apodization, and the resulting artifacts, while avoiding systematic errors that have affected other models. Even severely overlapped peaks, beyond the point of coalescence, can be distinguished in both simulated and experimental data. We show that the method can measure unresolved backbone scalar couplings directly from a 2D proton-nitrogen spectrum of a de novo designed mini protein. The algorithm is implemented in the FitNMR open-source R package and can be used to analyze nearly any type of single or multidimensional data from small molecules or biomolecules.},
